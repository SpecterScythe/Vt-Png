# Vt-Png
Something akin to a simple Vtube studio for Png's. It will track what your face does, And in tern change what png is displayed

This application will use your default camera, and create a folder in its directory to store the images with names it can understand. it will never take store or use information other then to make the application work. none of the information will ever leave your pc.

Before running the application please run the setup file. to run the app please use this "python Tracking.py --shape-predictor shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat".

afterwards its pretty simple its a basic ui thats what i would call simple to use. you will probably have to adjust the config file to work with your face.

every part of the config has an example of what raising or lowering it would mean so you can asjust it to what you like, you can run the tracker without any pngs

to test what works best with your face, though you will have to exit and re-enter to have the changes be applied

If this gets popular enough future updates may include but are not limited too. A Better ui, Different mouth movements based on not just mouth open but also sound decible. better smile, And Better blink detection. More and different face tracking such as head rotation, turning your head to the side, Indevidual left and right blink/wink detection, and eyebrow movement tracking.
